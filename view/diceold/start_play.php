    <h1>Play dice</h1>
    <p>
        Roll your hand of dices. The sum is your points, unless one of the dices shows a 1 in that case you lose all points and it's the computers turn. If you didn't roll a one you can chose to roll a new hand of dices and add that result to your points. If you roll a one on the new hand you lose all points, including those from the previous hands this turn.
